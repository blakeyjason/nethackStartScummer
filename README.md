# nethackStartScummer
Psst - wanna cheat and start with a good wizard in nethack?

This script uses Expect to do the dirty work.  You night need to:

sudo pip3 install pexpect


Tested on Nethack version 3.6.1, Python 3.7.5

If your list of wanted items gets long, it can take many, MANY iterations before you get your character.

Thanks,
jason
